### the ".env" file is also added to the ".dockerignore" and ".gitignore" files,
### to NOT pass them to the container (".dockerignore") or to GitHub (".gitignore")
###
### this ".env" file is then "passed" into the debugging container via ".vscode/tasks.json"
### in the "dockerRun" section:

#	"dockerRun": {

### Build Vars ###
IMAGE_BASE=madiator2011/better-launcher
IMAGE_TAG=dev

### APP specific Vars ###
DISABLE_PULLBACK_MODELS=False
# the default is, that app model files, which are found locally (in only one app),
# get automatically "pulled-back" into the '/workspace/shared_models' folder.
# From there they will be re-linked back not only to their own "pulled-back" model-type folder,
# but also will be linked back into all other corresponding app model-type folders.
# So the "pulled-back" model is automatically shared to all installed apps.
#
# if you NOT want this behaviour, then set DISABLE_PULLBACK_MODELS=True

### USER specific Vars and Secrets (Tokens) - TODO: adjust this for your personal settings ###
PUBLIC_KEY=ssh-ed25519 XXX...XXX usermail@domain.com
HF_TOKEN=hf_XXX...XXX
CIVITAI_API_TOKEN=XXX.XXX

### RUNPOD specific Vars ###
RUNPOD_PUBLIC_IP=127.0.0.1
