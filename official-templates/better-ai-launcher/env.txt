### for local debugging fill-in/update YOUR env values and secrets
### and rename this file as ".env" (hidden file with NO extension)
### the ".env" file is also added to the ".dockerignore" and ".gitignore" files,
### to NOT pass them to the container (".dockerignore") or to GitHub (".gitignore")
###
### this ".env" file is then "passed" into the debugging container via ".vscode/tasks.json"
### in the "dockerRun" section:
#
#	"dockerRun": {
#		"envFiles": ["${workspaceFolder}/.env"], // pass additional env-vars from ".env" file to container


### Build Vars ###
IMAGE_BASE=madiator2011/better-launcher
IMAGE_TAG=dev

### APP specific Vars ###
DISABLE_PULLBACK_MODELS=False
# the default is, that app model files, which are found locally (in only one app),
# get automatically "pulled-back" into the '/workspace/shared_models' folder.
# From there they will be re-linked back not only to their own "pulled-back" model-type folder,
# but also will be linked back into all other corresponding app model-type folders.
# So the "pulled-back" model is automatically shared to all installed apps.
#
# if you NOT want this behaviour, then set DISABLE_PULLBACK_MODELS=True,
# otherwise set DISABLE_PULLBACK_MODELS=False [default] which is the same as NOT setting this ENV var at all.

### USER specific Vars and Secrets (Tokens) - TODO: adjust this for your personal settings ###
PUBLIC_KEY=ssh-ed25519 XXX...XXX usermail@domain.com
# Note: make sure to use the **full line content** from your `"*.pub"` key file!

HF_TOKEN=hf_XXX...XXX
# Your `HuggingFace` token.
# Can be a `READ` scoped token for downloading your "private" models, or "gated models" as e.g. `Flux.1 Dev` or METAs `Llama LLM models`.
# The HF_TOKEN need to be a `READ/WRITE` scoped token, if you plan also to UPLOAD models to "HuggingFace" later,
# when we have Trainer Apps like "Kohya" or "ai-toolkit".

CIVITAI_API_TOKEN=XXX.XXX
# Your `CivitAI` API token.
# Note: CivitAI currently only provides a `FULL` user token, acting as `you`,
# so be careful with how to setup this token and with whom you share it!

### RUNPOD specific Vars ###
RUNPOD_PUBLIC_IP=127.0.0.1
RUNPOD_TCP_PORT_22=22
